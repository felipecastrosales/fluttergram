<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>

<p align="center">
   A practical and simples Instagram Clone developed with <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/responsive_framework" target="_blank">responsive_framework</a>, an incredible package.<br>
   This project using this package gave me a lot of productivity regarding responsiveness in Flutter, because it adapts my UI for each type of screen, without so much concern.<br>
   If you want to learn how to do a similar one, access the course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/responsividade-flutter/?referralCode=A3737FD68BCAFEFCE3C8" target="_blank">Responsiveness in the Flutter | Mobile, Tablet, Web e Desktop</a>, of which I am a teaching instructor! I hope you enjoy!

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

<p>
   That was my second experience creating a fully responsive Flutter Aplication.<br>
   This time, I used responsive_framework, of which I had a very high productivity, and I really liked it.<br>
   Again, as in the previous project, I hosted the application on Firebase Hosting, and this time, without any difficulty and challenge, it was simple and practical.
   Once again I learned too much from Responsivity!!! 📱💻🖥
